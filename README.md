# Predictive Analysis

This repository contains code for predictive analysis using a sample dataset. It includes an API that can be tested locally. Follow the instructions below to set up, run the code in Google Colab, and test the API endpoints.

## Repository Contents
1. `Predictive_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main codebase.
2. `sample_dataset.csv`: A sample dataset used for the predictive analysis.
3. This README file: Instructions on setup, usage, and API testing.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google Colab (browser access)
- Postman (for testing API endpoints)
- Required Python packages (specified in the notebook)

## Steps to Run the Code

### 1. Open the Notebook in Google Colab
1. Download the `Predictive_Analysis.ipynb` file from the repository.
2. Upload the file to Google Colab:
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Click on **File** > **Upload Notebook**.
   - Choose the `Predictive_Analysis.ipynb` file from your local system.

### 2. Upload the Dataset in Colab
1. After opening the notebook, ensure you also have the `sample_dataset.csv` file.
2. Upload the dataset in Colab:
   - In the left panel, click on the folder icon.
   - Click **Upload**, and select `sample_dataset.csv`.
   - The dataset will be accessible in the Colab environment.

### 3. Install Required Libraries
The first few cells of the notebook install the required libraries. Ensure you run these cells sequentially. Typical libraries include:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `flask` (for API implementation)

Run the cells in order to set up the environment.

### 4. Execute the Code
1. Run the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation cells.
2. Follow the notebook's instructions for model analysis.

### 5. Start the API Locally
At the end of the notebook, there is a section to start the Flask API. Execute the cell to initiate the API on a local server. It will display a URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`) where the API is running.

## Testing the API with Postman

### 1. Install Postman
If you haven't already, download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### 2. Set Up Postman Requests
1. Open Postman and create a new request.
2. Select the **POST** method.
3. Enter the API endpoint URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict`).
4. Go to the **Body** tab and select **raw**.
5. Choose **JSON** as the data format and input the sample data in JSON format. For example:
   ```json
   {
       "feature1": 5.1,
       "feature2": 3.5,
       "feature3": 1.4,
       "feature4": 0.2
   }
   ```

### 3. Send the Request
Click **Send** to test the endpoint. If everything is set up correctly, the API will return a response with the prediction.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure the Flask server is running in the Colab environment.
- Use the provided dataset format when testing endpoints.
- Verify that all required libraries are installed.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates predictive analysis using a sample dataset and provides an API for real-time predictions. Follow the steps above to set up, run, and test the code and API. For additional questions, feel free to open an issue in this repository.
